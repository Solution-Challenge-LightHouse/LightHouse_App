# LightHouse_App

The LightHouse is question bank and forum for education. We expact to feel joy and reduce stress for Korean and international students.
LightHouse App gives students access to question bank and forum.

I created an app using Flutter. Through Flutter, we were able to create fast and high-level results based on wide inclusion and scalability.
In the social login process, the security was strengthened using firebase, and the user's information was checked and converted through Google Map api.
